***Prototype Name :- Sustainable Green Energy : Unlocking Energy Efficiency with Clustering Technique***

## **Problem Statement**
*Background*

Energy access, economic development, and sustainability are critical factors for global development. Countries exhibit diverse characteristics in terms of energy consumption, renewable energy adoption, economic growth, and emissions. Understanding these patterns helps policymakers, businesses, and researchers in making informed decisions.

 * *Objective -* The goal of this project is to classify countries into distinct clusters based on their energy and economic characteristics. Additionally, AI-driven insights will explain why a country belongs to a specific cluster, aiding better understanding and decision-making.

## **Solution :-**
This AI-driven clustering model offers a powerful tool for analyzing and explaining country-level energy and economic trends. The integration of KMeans clustering with LLM-based textual explanations enhances interpretability, making the system useful for a broad audience, including policymakers, businesses, researchers, and the general public.

The deployment provides cluster classification results based on user input for a specific country.

### **Clustering Analysis :**

*Cluster 0: Moderately Developed Country*

*Cluster 1: Low Energy Access Region*

*Cluster 2: High-Industrialized Economy*

*Cluster 3: Moderately Industrialized Economy*
